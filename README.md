Stake-Based Calculation:
In a Proof of Stake system, rewards are typically proportional to the stake.
Formula: Your Reward = (Your Stake / Total Stake) * Block Reward * Blocks per Period
Time-Based Estimation:
Users can estimate rewards over time:Daily Reward = (Your Stake / Total Stake) * Block Reward * (Blocks per Day)
Annual Reward = Daily Reward * 365
